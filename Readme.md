# ERC-XXXX: UI/UX Pattern for Decentralized Apps

## TODO

- [ ] use lighter javascript for initial dappz call()
- [ ] display qr code for self-linking to the launcher
- [ ] show spinner or status from .dappz fetch (can be slow)
- [ ] include build hash in loading screen
- [ ] fix loader body so it can be replaced without losing classes, attributes
- [ ] show identicon-like outputs for contract address, contract URI, chain/network
- [ ] possible to pause loader? would enable use of QR, etc
- [ ] about menu; link to EIP, describe DAppz, etc
- [ ] splash screen/SVG
- [x] put diagnostics in an html element, not in body
